# Roadside forms automation browser extension
*A minimal extension to make filling out roadside digital forms easier.*

## Description
When you install this extension in your browser and go to the Digital Forms DEV or TEST environment, a "Fill" button will be added to the top-left corner of the page. After you have selected a 24-hour form, click the Fill button to fill out the fields quickly.

## Installation
To install this extension, you must be using a Chromium-based browser like Edge or Chrome. Go to Settings > Extensions and enable developer mode. After enabling developer mode, you should see the option "Load Unpacked" appear. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the folder where this file is located. 

You may wish to pin the extension so it is always visible. The icon will show in colour and the Fill button will appear only when the DEV or TEST environments are loaded.

Steps:
 1. Go to **Extensions** in the browser settings.
 2. Enable the **Developer Mode** toggle (this allows you to side-load the extension).
 3. Select the **Load Unpacked** link on the Extensions page.
 4. Enable the extension, if needed.
 5. Browse to the DEV or TEST environment.
